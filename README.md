# hebrewsOne

This was my first personal project as web developer. The purpose of the project was to stage a commentary in a visually appealing and functional format. My motivation for the project was the drab appearance of all such material on the internet. 
The commentary is my own, and in based on the Greek text of the Epistle to the Hebrews, New Testament. 

To make the site appealing, I focused on adding a pretty, but subtle background image; choosing a calm and simple color scheme; choosing a pair of fonts that interacted well; and, most difficult of all, trying to make large blocks of text less overwhelming or abrasive. I achieved the latter in two different ways depending on where the data was coming from. If the data was hard coded, I added spans to certain words and altered the properties of the text. If the data was coming from the JSON document, I iterated over it with a JavaScript function, which looked for certain characters and added spans and then CSS properties.
